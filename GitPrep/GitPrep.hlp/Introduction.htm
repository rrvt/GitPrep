<h2>GitPrep</h2>
<p>
Uploading an application or project to Git does not need object files and other files created during the 
build process.  Git Prep was created to delete most of the temporary files created during the build.
I have also placed database and csv extensions on the list of files to delete.  Other extensions may be 
placed or removed from the list with just a recompile.  Sorry, I did not make the list dynamic...
</p>
<p>
There are only three useful functions and they are described in the 
<a href="Operations.htm">operations page</a>.
</p>
<p>
It is still recommended that each directory be examined just to be sure that we got them all.
